REQUIRED computational parameters
---------------------------------

1) Hydrodynamic flow model
**************************
Contains model name and phase number for multiphase models.
For the pressure-velocity- (Kapila's) and velocity-equilibrium models, the volume fraction can either be null or not and this choice is determined by the parameter alphaNull.
For single phase model (example: Euler), numberPhases is optionnal and is 1 as default.
Attribute numberTransports is optionnal and is set to 0 as default.
Available models are: Euler, PressureVelocityEq (Kapila), VelocityEq, VelocityEqTotEnergy, TemperaturePressureVelocityEq, EulerHomogeneous, EulerKorteweg, NonLinearSchrodinger.

2) Equations of states
**********************
<EOS> node's number depend on the phase number. Each node contains the name of an EOS file that must be present in the "ECOGEN/libEOS/" folder.

<EOS name="IG_air.xml"/>

MODELS SPECIFICITIES
--------------------
Caution: For EulerHomogeneous, the two attributes for phase number of liquid and vapor phases must be added.

OPTIONNAL model parameters
--------------------------

*) Advected variable names
**************************
<transport> additionnal node's number depend on the transported variable number. Each node specify the advected variable name. These variables may be used for additionnal physics.

*) Low-Mach preconditioning
***************************
Apply low-Mach preconditioning to the selected model, useful for low-speed flows.

*) 1D geometry with smooth cross section variation
**************************************************
In case of a 2D geometry with smooth cross section variation, it is possible to use a 1D geometry and reproduce 2D effects with this attribute. 
Only compatible with unstructured mesh defined with flow direction along the X-axis.
Boundary condition contributions in other directions than the X-axis should use nullFlux boundary condition (see initialConditionsVX.xml).

*) Additionnal physics (in dev)
*******************************
Flow model can be augmented by additionnal physical effects as surface tension, viscosity and conductive heat transfer.
a) Surface tension
------------------
This physical effect needs the name of advected variable used as color function for surface-tension terms as well as surface-tension coefficient in N/m.

b) Viscosity
------------
This physical effect needs the <physicalParameters> "mu" to be set in the EOS files.

Cylindrical (2D) or spherical (1D) symmetries are implemented.

*) Source terms
***************
Few source terms are already implemented, the order of integration can be EULER, RK2 (Runge-Kutta) or RK4.
It is possible to set source terms on a given zone of an unstructured mesh through physicalEntity tag (when not specified the source term is applied on the whole domain).
Be aware that the use of some source terms (e.g. gravity, MRF) on a specific region could lead to unexpected behavior.
