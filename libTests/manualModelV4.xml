Typical example for model input file version 4
---------------------------------------------------

<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" standalone = "yes"?>
<model>
  <flowModel name="Kapila" numberPhases="2" alphaNull="false"/>
  <EOS name="IG_air.xml"/>
  <EOS name="SG_water.xml"/>
</model>

---------------------------------
REQUIRED computational parameters
---------------------------------

1) Hydrodynamic flow model
**************************
Contains model name and phase number for multiphase models.
For Kapila's model, the volume fraction can either be null or not and this choice is determined by the parameter alphaNull.
For single phase model (example: Euler), numberPhases is optionnal and is 1 as default.
Attribute numberTransports is optionnal and is set to 0 as default.
Available models are : Euler, Kapila, ThermalEq, EulerHomogeneous.

2) Equations of states
**********************
<EOS> node's number depend on the phase number. Each node contains the name of an EOS file that must be present in the "ECOGEN/libEOS/" folder.

<EOS name="IG_air.xml"/>

MODELS SPECIFICITIES
--------------------
Caution: For EulerHomogeneous, the two attributes for phase number of liquid and vapor phases must be added.

OPTIONNAL model parameters
--------------------------

*) Advected variable names
**************************
<transport> additionnal node's number depend on the transported variable number. Each node specify the advected variable name. These variables may be used for additionnal physics.

*) Additionnal physics (in dev)
*******************************
Flow model can be augmented by additionnal physical effects as surface tension, viscosity and conductive heat transfer.
a) Surface tension
------------------
This physical effect needs the name of advected variable used as color function for surface-tension terms as well as surface-tension coefficient in N/m.

b) Viscosity
------------
This physical effect needs the <physicalParameters> "mu" to be set in the EOS files.

*) Symmetry terms
*****************
Cylindrical (2D) or spherical (1D) symmetries are implemented.
